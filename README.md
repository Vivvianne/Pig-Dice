# Pig-Dice
Author: Vivvianne Kimani

## Project Description
Pig dice game is played with a single six-sided die. This is a probability game, where two or more players can participate. 
In this case we have two players. The objective of the game is to reach 100 points. The first player to reach 100 points is 
declared the winner. The catch in this game is to know when to hold so that you do not loose the points already accumulated 
in the turn. When a player rolls a 1, the player looses all the points he'she accumulated in that specific round. 
So, a total of the point acculated in each round will the taken and the player to first reach 100 points is the winner.

## Behaviour Driven Development
Two players will key in their names in the slots provided, then one of them will click the start button. The log in like 
page will disaper/ hide and only the player console will show. Player one/two will roll the dice first. In each turn a player is allowed to roll the die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled or a player decides to hold and pass 
on the turn to his/her opponent. The number of player roll is added to the temporary score. If the player rolls a 1 he/she 
looses the temporary score, and the turn is passed to the opponent. If the palyer rolls any other number, he/she can decide 
to continue rolling, or the player can hold, thereby passing the turn to the opponent. So if the player decides to hold their 
turn, then the total(temporary score) is added to the total score.
